Please improve the design and structure of this microsite to make it look like a professional, modern B2B fintech/data platform. Follow the instructions below carefully:

1. Navigation
Add a clean, sticky top-right navigation bar

Include anchor links: Overview, Core Offerings, Why It Matters, Pricing, Contact

Keep the nav bar visible while scrolling and reduce its height slightly on scroll

Add a subtle shadow or border underneath the nav bar

2. Layout & Structure
Use max-width containers for all text content (e.g. max-w-4xl mx-auto) so content doesn’t stretch across the entire screen

Add extra spacing (py-16, mb-12) between sections for breathing room

Alternate section background colors: use light grey (#f9f9f9) or pale blue (#f0f4f8) to visually separate sections

3. Typography & Hierarchy
Use a clean, modern font like Inter or IBM Plex Sans

Make section titles large (text-3xl or text-4xl) and bold

Use clear hierarchy: titles, then subtitles, then body text

Increase line spacing (leading-relaxed) and padding for all paragraph text

4. Core Offerings Section
Convert the 3 offerings into cards with shadows and rounded corners

Add a hover effect (hover:shadow-lg, hover:scale-105, transition-all)

Each card should have:

A title

Short list of key features

Optional icon (if possible)

5. Pricing Section
Use the same card layout as Core Offerings

Add subtle divider lines or background tint behind pricing section

Make sure pricing cards are spaced and aligned consistently

6. CTA Button
Make the "Book Initial Call" button fixed at the bottom-right corner on desktop view only

Use a solid button style (e.g. dark blue background, white text, px-6 py-3, rounded-full)

Add hover effect to the button (hover:bg-opacity-90)

7. Animations and Interactions
Add fade-in animation for each section or card as the user scrolls into view

Only trigger animation once per section to avoid distraction

8. Footer
Create a clean footer with:

ZENPULSAR logo or wordmark (text is fine)
