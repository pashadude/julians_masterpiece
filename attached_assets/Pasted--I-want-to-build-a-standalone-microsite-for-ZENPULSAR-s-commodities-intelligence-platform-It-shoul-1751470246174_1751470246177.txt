I want to build a standalone microsite for ZENPULSAR's commodities intelligence platform. It should be inspired by our main site https://zenpulsar.com in tone and professionalism, but this microsite should use a white or light background, with a clean, product-focused, information-first design.

Design Requirements:

White/light background

Black or dark grey headings and clean sans-serif typography (e.g. Inter, IBM Plex Sans)

No animations, video backgrounds, parallax, or unnecessary JavaScript

Desktop and tablet-first layout (mobile optional)

Minimalist, readable, and fast-loading

Site Structure (single-page or scroll-based layout):

1. Hero Section
Title: ZENPULSAR COMMODITIES INTELLIGENCE

Subtitle: Real-time geopolitical signals, AI-driven sentiment, and stress-tested insight for commodity trading.

CTA Button: Request Demo

2. Overview
Text block with left-aligned paragraph:

ZENPULSAR delivers structured, AI-driven intelligence for commodity trading and risk management. Our platform combines global news monitoring, geopolitical signal extraction, and modular AI agents to replace outdated workflows and enable faster, better-informed decisions.
We help trading teams stress-test strategies, detect early geopolitical disruptions, and extract actionable sentiment from market-moving events — all in real time.

3. Core Offerings (Three Columns or Cards)
Offering 1: News & Sentiment-Based Trading Signals
Signals extracted from over 3 million daily articles in 185 languages using advanced NLP and LLMs

Each article scored as bullish or bearish, with confidence level included

Licensed content used for structured signal extraction

Coverage includes copper, aluminium, urea, phosphate, sugar, grains, energy

Captures signals on real-world disruptions: strikes, sanctions, export bans, weather

Proven correlation with intraday and T-day price movements (especially for copper and aluminium)

Feed/API/MCP integration-ready

Works with internal strategies via AI agent pipelines

Offering 2: Geopolitical & Tariff Risk Factor Matrix
Stress-test trading strategies against war, sanctions, export restrictions, and regime instability

Live geopolitical data and narrative signals, not backward-looking indicators

Built-in taxonomy of policy triggers: tariffs, export controls, regulatory shifts, diplomatic tension

Supports scenario testing, volatility forecasting, and regional hedging

Currently in development with early design partners, incl. Trafigura and Open Mineral

Offering 3: Multi-Agent AI Systems
Modular AI agents designed for commodity-specific research tasks

Agents can work autonomously or in pipelines

Example agents include:
– Rice news summarizer (used by MDM)
– Urea quote tracker (CFR Brazil, FOB Egypt)
– Argus report parser for fertilizer data

Replaces PDFs, emails, and chat-driven workflows

Custom-built or standardized per market, region, or report format

4. Why It Matters
Short text block + bullet points:

The commodities sector remains structurally behind in intelligence. Most traders still rely on PDFs, emails, and generic sentiment tools built for equities. Meanwhile, real-world shocks — from coup attempts to export bans — increasingly define commodity risk.

Real-time geopolitical and sentiment signals tied to specific contracts, geographies, and products

Modular AI agents that automate research and workflow

Strategy stress-testing tools for real-world volatility

ZENPULSAR does not build dashboards — we replace inefficient decision infrastructure

5. Call to Action (End of Page)
Centered text and button:

Text: Start with a pilot. Demonstrate ROI before scaling.
Button: Book Initial Call

6. Footer
Simple footer layout:

ZENPULSAR logo or wordmark

Link to main site: https://zenpulsar.com

Contact: info@zenpulsar.com

Optional: inline contact form or "Request Access" link

Tech Notes:

Use HTML and TailwindCSS (or plain CSS)

No React required unless helpful for reusable components

Static or lightweight build preferred for fast load and low error rate

Make all sections modular and easy to update later (e.g. adding copper, rice, or sugar-specific agents)
